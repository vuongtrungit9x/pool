### We are trying to reborn NOMP. Need contributors!

# Neoscrypt algo fixed

-------
### Node Open Mining Portal consists from 3 main modules:
* Main module - https://github.com/nasa8x/node-open-mining-portal
* Stratum Pool - https://github.com/nasa8x/node-stratum-pool
* Node Multihashing libraries https://github.com/nasa8x/node-multi-hashing

Stratum Pool can be replaced with node-merged-pool (it's made in UNOMP)
Adding new algos threw Node Multihashing libraries.

Current version: v1.0.10

-------
### Install
```
git clone https://github.com/vuongtrungit9x/pool.git pool
cd pool
npm install
node init.js
```
-------
### Requirements
* Node 8.x.x or higher
* Coin daemon
* Redis Server

### Run in Docker

1) Correct configs appropriately to your environment in docker directory
2) ```cd docker```
3) ```docker build -t nomp .```
4) ```docker run -d --name nomp -v $(pwd)/config:/opt/config nomp ```

You will need to expose some ports to make it accessible from outside. You can achieve this by adding option -p HOST_PORT:CONTAINER_PORT in 4th step

You can see the logs of the server with ```docker logs -f nomp```, or jump into container with ```docker exec -it nomp```.

### Hashing algorithms
#### Working
|   | Algorithm | Comment|
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| ✓ | __lyra2z__ | Working with Zcoin. Infinex need testing|
| ✓ | __NeoScrypt__ | Onexcoin, working, need tests on other coins! |
| ? | __Groestl__ | tested only shares with AuroraCoin, blocks not tested |
| ? | __Scrypt__ | tested with AntiLiteCoin, 1CREDIT, ArgusCoin, WAYAWOLFCOIN and many others |
| ? | __SHA256__ | tested with VCOIN, don't use with BTC, no Segwit tested |
| ? | __X11__ | tested with BrainCoin, CannabisCoin, AdzCoin and many others |
| ? | __X16r__ | tested with RavenCoin |

### Notes
#### Lyra2Z
If you are going to test ZCoin (lyra2z) on testnet, make sure you are uncommented proper lines in transactions.js in https://github.com/nasa8x/node-stratum-pool 

There is a ```payment-fixes``` branch where i fixed previous blockHash problem and corrected payouts. Check it out in this and stratum server module.
